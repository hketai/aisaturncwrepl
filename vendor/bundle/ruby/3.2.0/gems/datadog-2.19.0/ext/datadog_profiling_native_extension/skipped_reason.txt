the `pkg-config` system tool is missing. This issue can usually be fixed by installing one of the following: the `pkg-config` package on Homebrew and Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux; the `pkgconf` package on Arch and Alpine-based Linux; the `pkgconf-pkg-config` package on Fedora/Red Hat-based Linux. (Tip: When fixing this, ensure `pkg-config` is installed **before** running `bundle install`, and remember to clear any installed gems cache).
