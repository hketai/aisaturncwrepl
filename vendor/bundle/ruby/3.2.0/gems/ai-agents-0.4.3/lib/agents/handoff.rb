module Agents
  # A special tool that enables agents to transfer conversations to other specialized agents.
  # Handoffs are implemented as tools (following OpenAI's pattern) because this allows
  # the LLM to naturally decide when to transfer based on the conversation context.
  #
  # ## How Handoffs Work
  # 1. Agent A is configured with handoff_agents: [Agent B, Agent C]
  # 2. This automatically creates HandoffTool instances for B and C
  # 3. The LLM can call these tools like any other tool
  # 4. The tool signals the handoff through context
  # 5. The Runner detects this and switches to the new agent
  #
  # ## Loop Prevention
  # The library prevents infinite handoff loops by processing only the first handoff
  # tool call in any LLM response. This is handled automatically by the Chat class
  # which detects handoff tools and processes them separately from regular tools.
  #
  # ## Why Tools Instead of Instructions
  # Using tools for handoffs has several advantages:
  # - LLMs reliably use tools when appropriate
  # - Clear schema tells the LLM when each handoff is suitable
  # - No parsing of free text needed
  # - Works consistently across different LLM providers
  #
  # @example Basic handoff setup
  #   billing_agent = Agent.new(name: "Billing", instructions: "Handle payments")
  #   support_agent = Agent.new(name: "Support", instructions: "Technical help")
  #
  #   triage = Agent.new(
  #     name: "Triage",
  #     instructions: "Route users to the right team",
  #     handoff_agents: [billing_agent, support_agent]
  #   )
  #   # Creates tools: handoff_to_billing, handoff_to_support
  #
  # @example How the LLM sees it
  #   # User: "I can't pay my bill"
  #   # LLM thinks: "This is a payment issue, I should transfer to billing"
  #   # LLM calls: handoff_to_billing()
  #   # Runner switches to billing_agent for the next turn
  #
  # @example Multiple handoff handling
  #   # Single LLM response with multiple handoff calls:
  #   # Call 1: handoff_to_support() -> Processed and executed
  #   # Call 2: handoff_to_billing() -> Ignored (only first handoff processed)
  #   # Result: Only transfers to Support Agent
  class HandoffTool < Tool
    attr_reader :target_agent

    def initialize(target_agent)
      @target_agent = target_agent

      # Set up the tool with a standardized name and description
      @tool_name = "handoff_to_#{target_agent.name.downcase.gsub(/\s+/, "_")}"
      @tool_description = "Transfer conversation to #{target_agent.name}"

      super()
    end

    # Override the auto-generated name to use our specific name
    def name
      @tool_name
    end

    # Override the description
    def description
      @tool_description
    end

    # Handoff tools now work with the extended Chat class for proper handoff handling
    # No longer need context signaling - the Chat class detects handoffs directly
    def perform(_tool_context)
      # Simply return the transfer message - Chat class will handle the handoff
      "I'll transfer you to #{@target_agent.name} who can better assist you with this."
    end

    # NOTE: RubyLLM will handle schema generation internally when needed
    # Handoff tools have no parameters, which RubyLLM will detect automatically
  end
